# progressiverepublic.github.io

Welcome to the README for this GitHub Pages site. I'm J.D. Brown, and I'll be working on this site over the next few weeks. The idea is an unoriginal one: create a site where I talk about politics, economics, social issues, and more related to the idea of progressivism, as I see it. This doesn't mean that I'm going to be promoting the ideas of a single politician, or even a group of politicians. If anything, the current American politicians who are progressives in name are late to the party, as Theodore Roosevelt and others like him in the early 20th century were truly the original progressives in the forefront of our political theater. 

Thanks for stopping by!
