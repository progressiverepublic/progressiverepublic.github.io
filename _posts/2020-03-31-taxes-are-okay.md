title: "Taxes are Okay, and We Need Them to Survive."

<h2>Tax Rants are better than Tax Cuts</h2>

I think it is beyond time for the American people to come to terms with a truth that, at first, may be hard to swallow. In fact, I would anticipate that there are portions of the country who are incapable of hearing the following assertion without clasping their fists in anger and gnashing their teeth in frustration. I'm prepared to take that risk, however, as the discomfort of others, without saying anything hateful, should not stop someone from speaking their mind. They just have to be equally ready to face the potential consequences for their statements. I have no problem standing by my thoughts on this topic, so without further delay, let's continue.

There is an overwhelming consensus by the conservatives of America that taxes are inherently bad. And from that basic opinion, we have seen the following stances further... articulated by conservatives with any kind of platform available. 

* “Simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes on families struggling to pay their bills.”  -<i> President Ronald Reagan</i>
* "I am for anyone that will give me lower taxes, stop all this stupid spending. Whoever promises me that gets this chicken's vote." - <i>Joan Rivers</i>
* "The Republican promise is for policies that create economic growth. Republicans believe lower taxes, less regulation, balanced budgets, a solvent Social Security and Medicare will stimulate economic growth." - <i>Senator Rand Paul</i>

I could continue to provide examples that walk us further down a rabbit hole of speeches regarding how government should be as small as possible, taxes as low as possible, and how the American Spirit can thrive under those conditions.

The problem with that, however, is that it is based on logic that is completely false in its origin. 

Before I get too much further into the technicalities, it is worth noting that some of you reading this may not know how taxes are actually assessed on your income. To keep the example as simple as possible, think of tax brackets as buckets. The first bracket is the smallest bucket, and is taxed at the lowest income tax rate. The buckets and rates get bigger from there. If the first bucket holds $5,000, the next holds $10,000, and so forth, and you made $20,000 one year, then your first $5,000 earned fills up the first bucket, and is taxed at the rate associated with that bucket. The next $10,000 fills the second bucket, and is taxed at that rate, and whatever is left goes into the next bucket and is taxed at that rate. This means that not all of your income is taxed the same - it's progressively taxed more as you earn more. For those of you that are more visual learners, here is a very simple diagram provided by wrennefinancial.com:

<br />
Therefore, it stands that if you make more money, you would pay more in taxes, but the first $5,000 you make is taxed the same way as someone who maked less than you do. This also means that if you get a raise and you see your new total income puts you into a new tax bracket, you don't suddenly earn less than you would have before. With that out of the way, I'll keep going.

In 1982, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA), signed by Reagan, went into effect for effective federal tax rates on income. Taxes were lowered for every income bracket, and the highest three brackets from the previous year, with income ranges starting at $109,400, $162,400, and $215,400, removed completely. This meant that the highest tax bracket, which taxed every dollar earned by an individual after $215,400 at a 70% rate, to making the highest rate 50% at any dollar earned above $85,600. Percentage-wise, as stated before, every American was now paying a lower rate. However, as an overall impact to their income, this grossly benefitted those making above $85,600. Now, instead of paying a tax rate of 59% on every dollar above that line, you paid 50%, and, more importantly for the ultra-rich, it <i>never increased from there</i>. And if you are thinking that these brackets are no big deal and seem really low, the average American income in 1982, according to the Social Security Administration<sup>1</sup>, was a mere <b>$14,531.34</b>.

One of the great promises of those who would lower taxes is this - by lowering taxes, we are opening up the ability for average Americans to invest, pay bills, and pull themselves up by their bootstraps. The old Jacksonian saying always finds a way to turn it's gnarly self into a conversation on taxes, it seems. However, I don't know how much in savings this is really generating for the average American. For that kind of statement to be true, you would have to see the growth of the average American income match the growth of the cost of living. This means that as housing, cars, gas, food, healthcare, etc., all go up in price, so too does average income. If that were true, and that's an impossible "if" (spoiler alert), then I think there is validity to that argument. However, that environment only exists in a fairy tale. It only exists in the minds of those who paint the picture that they want the average voter to see. I am not saying that there is an intent to deceive, as I cannot prove such a thing definitively, and I firmly believe that our justice system should make such a determination, but by all reason and logic there is only an apparent falsehood to this belief. Just looking at records from census data and other market averages, since the year 2000, the average American income has nominally risen just 2.69%. I say nominally, because I have not adjusted for inflation, which would actually make all of these numbers <i>significantly worse</i>. At the same time, the average cost of a house since then has risen 98.25% and annual healthcare costs for the average person have risen 144.14%.

To those who would point out that between now and 2000 we had the terrorist attacks of 9/11, a foreign war, the Housing Crisis and eventual Great Recession, Obamacare, or any other talking points of the conservative reasoning for economic changes on the American people, why did the housing and healthcare industries not see similar hits? Why did they grow at rates that are orders of magnitude greater than that of the average income?

So sure, cut my taxes. Save me less than $1000 per year on my tax bill. Odds are, I'm already swimming out of my depth in my mortgage or rent payment, health insurance premiums, doctors bill, and more. The stock market made leaps and bounds over the course of that time, but where is my income adjustment? 

I'm not advocating for government income supplementaion, or for the government to regulate what workers are paid (though they are in control of the Minimum wage, which no other first-world government controls and adjusts the way we do). However, the better endeavor they should undertake would be to push businesses to pay their employees a better wage through regulations or controls. But if you look back up to the part of this article where I quoted Senator Rand Paul, that isn't in the Republican idea of economic expansion.

Now, here's where the rubber starts to meet the proverbial road of economics. The same government officials who want to lower your taxes, also want to deregulate business controls and measures to protect your ability to work and earn a fair wage, a fair benefits package, and more. So who would benefit the most from lower taxes, especially on the highest earning Americans, and a deregulation of business controls and measures?

The answer is simple: the same people benefit from both of those things.

The richest Americans are often owners of stock, investments, companies, and property, all of which are taxed by the federal government at a lower rate than that of their nominal "income." If you want to know how the richest among us earn more money every year while those that work two jobs can't find a way to get ahead, you should be able to see that by now.

So what does this have to do with taxes? Why should you care about how the rich have it better than you and your lower tax bill doesn't actually help you all that much?

Because you've been deceived into believing that your extra saved dollars from tax cuts will go further than any government program to use those funds wisely. And now we enter part two of this lengthy extravaganza into one man's rant against tax cuts - spending habits.

<h2> Spending - The Long Con </h2>

Here is the second area that needs consternation. Even if I somehow managed to persuade you that lowering taxes has been handled unfairly and doesn't really help you all that much, I now have to sell you on the bigger problem - the role of the federal government and instilling trust into a system that we have grown to dislike so much, just talking about politics in public is frowned upon.

Let's start by telling you some news - Social Security and Medicare are not paid out of your income taxes. That's right, you actually pay those in the form of Payroll Taxes (woo more tax jargon!) and they are actually more burdensome to the poorest among us than any income tax. It's a split tax paid by your employer and you. You each pay 7.65% of your income to this, every paycheck, and your employer matches it to come up to 15.3% of your total income. However, there's a catch - most of that goes into Social Security, and after you hit the cap, which is now north of $130,000, you don't have to pay that tax anymore, and neither does your employer. You are then on the hook for paying only into Medicare, which is taxed at 1.45% of your earned income, unless you earn more than $200,000 or $250,000, depending if you are single or married, in which case you pay 2.35%. Now, believe it or not, this does mean that those making above the Social Security tax cap are limited by how much they will get from Social Security one day to that cap, but it also means they are getting a tax cut after that point and now have more disposable income to play with from that tax relief. 

This is incredibly complicated, but all of that was to say that income taxes don't pay for Social Security or Medicare. We have a separate tax for that.

Now, income tax should <i>ideally</i> be used on the areas that matter the most. What are those, you ask? According to what money the government spends, most of it (about 90%) goes to two categories: discretionary spending and mandatory spending. If you aren't sure what those two categories of spending are, here's how they are defined by the Congressional Budget Office:

* <b>Mandatory Spending</b>: Mandatory—or direct—spending includes spending for entitlement programs and certain other payments to people, businesses, and state and local governments. Mandatory spending is generally governed by statutory criteria; it is not normally set by annual appropriation acts. Outlays for the nation’s three largest entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) and for many smaller programs (unemployment compensation, retirement programs for federal employees, student loans, and deposit insurance, for example) are mandatory spending. Social Security and some other mandatory spending programs are in effect indefinitely, but some (for example, some agriculture programs) expire at the end of a given period. Roughly 60 percent of federal spending in 2012 (other than for the government’s net interest costs) was mandatory. Legislation that changed direct spending would, by itself, affect the budget deficit because no further legislative action would be required for the change in spending to occur.<sup>2</sup>

* <b>Discretionary Spending</b>: The authority for discretionary spending stems from annual appropriation acts, which are under the control of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Most defense, education, and transportation programs, for example, are funded that way, as are a variety of other federal programs and activities. Those appropriations are subject to a set of budget enforcement rules and processes that differ from those that apply to mandatory spending. As the Congress considers appropriation acts, CBO tallies the budget authority those acts would provide and estimates the outlays that would result.<sup>2</sup>

In other words - Mandatory spending is required by law. Congress would need to pass new laws and the President sign them in order for these things to change, which has its own set of difficulties associated with it. Discretionary spending, however, has more direct control from members of the House and Senate. There are some programs included here that based on category, such as defense, education, or transporation programs, that seem like they should be Mandatory, but if there are no laws specifically outlining what is to be spent on what program, these things can only be funded at the urging of Representatives and Senators. This spending is also the easiest to cut, as none of those initiatives are required - though many items are necessary for the good of the American people.

Now, the next logical question to ask is <i>"how much in each category do we spend?"</i>

Data from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) at the White House can be hard to come by. Sites such as <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org">nationalpriorities.org</a> collect this data and turn it into easy-to-read graphics. One of their latest works collected data from 2015, when 55% of our spending went to Mandatory categories, and 29% of our spending went to Discretionary spending. Here's a visual breakdown of the these categories from that year, provided by the same site:

This tangled web is woven by years upon years upon years of debate, reasoning, partisan tactics, responding to changing needs and adversity, the times we live in, whether or not we are in a war, and any number of other factors that have developed over time. The important thing to remember is this:

<h3 align="center">Spending isn't a bad thing.</h3>

Spending is what empowers the government to providing services and oversight into improving the lives of the citizens of the country. There are necessary spending items that are overlooked by citizens, because without them, the burden would fall upon states to completely perform all of these tasks individually. This would create 50 different military spending commitments, welfare programs, etc., and lead to different treatments of citizens based solely on where they decided to live. And while some of you reading this are committed to that as a concept from the ideal of being a Federalist Government, I assert that the rest of the world and the economy doesn't judge us based on a state-by-state set of problems and solutions - they only see the United States as a single entity. How would a commander-in-chief reasonably manage the efforts of the military of the nation if the military differs in commitment via funding and control on a state-by-state basis? Why stop at states? Why not have militaries of counties, or even cities?

When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in WWII, they didn't declare war on Hawaii. They declared war on the United States. So to those wondering why a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington control so much of their lives - that's why. We live in a different world than we did even 20 years ago. Now imagine how much it has changed since the Founders wrote the Constitution. They were writing a document that could hold up to the test of time, but they could never have imagined the world as we know it today. 

So what's the point of all this? What's the point of saying all of these words on spending, and whether it is right or wrong or justified or how it works or anything else? Well, here it is: <b>without adequate taxation (which is income to the government) and adequate spending programs, the country falls apart.</b> Taxation is okay. And I have not even expanded upon the theories that drive improved government programs, such as Medicare for All, where the theory of paying for prevention is more cost-effective than paying for the emergency. Adequate spending should be driven by how well those tax dollars are used to solve a problem. Not how well they contain fires, unless containment is the only option left for dealing with a specific problem. 

We are represented and can vote in change, if we see fit. Taxes should be as high as we can reasonably tolerate to allow for the more money to go to initiatives that are underfunded and will fail if we do nothing, like Social Security. Spending is complex, but is so because the world we live in and the challenges we face are complicated. Complexity is not a bad thing - it's a necessary evil to the realities of governing. And if we cannot reasonably begin to understand this, then there is no hope for the federal government to do anything of usefulness in the eyes of those who criticize it. Only through learning, understanding, and discussion can we better grasp the meaning behind all of these endeavors and then truly try to move on to questions that <b>need</b> the discussion - such as "How do we fix Social Security?", "How do we setup adequate, consistent funding for the Military based on real needs?", and more.

But that's the point of the conservative tax cut proposals. They sound great in small bites, but when you start to unpack the methods and impact of those ideas, you start to wonder if they are truly representatives of the people, or just of those that write checks to their campaigns.
