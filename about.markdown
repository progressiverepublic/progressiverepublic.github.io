Welcome to the site! I'm J.D. Brown, and I'm the writer behind this endeavor. I do not possess a degree in journalism, politics, economics, or philosophy. I do not possess any formal training in this area. I am an engaged citizen, participating as best I can in the political process that the Founding Fathers laid out for this country over 200 years ago. I have a full-time job outside of this site, but consider any activity that shapes my perception of the world to be something that could be reflected in the words published here.

This blog will not make every effort to be neutral. It will not make every effort to be professional. The guiding force and motivation behind this blog will be to articulate the arguments and solutions that I, myself, perceive to be of the most value or worth talking about.

If this approach does not sit well with you, or my thoughts are not what you personally agree with - then good! That's great! Everyone should have their own opinion, their own belief. What makes me tick is not what makes you move. I want to strike up a debate, strike up a conversation. I am of the belief that conversation and analysis by multiple parties can ultimately lead to greater outcomes for the benefit of all. I can only hope that this blog and the words I write are indicitive of that effort and can sway readers to that result.

Thanks,
J.D. Brown
